# LMRMapTracker
An HTML based Map/Check tracker for the La Mulana Randomizer

This is a "Map Tracker" for the thezerocat's [LaMulanaRandomizer](https://github.com/thezerothcat/LaMulanaRandomizer). Goal is for it to display all chest
checks in each field of the game, and allow for marking off when those checks have been completed. Pipe dream would be to either obtain or suss out
a flowchart for the game so I could also have this intelligently inform which checks are available based on current item set, but we'll see about that.

Also likely going to add in a tracker for what mantras have been said since I always forget that kinda stuff.
